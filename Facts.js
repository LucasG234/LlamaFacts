    "Llamas are large animals. They can be 6 feet tall and reach between 280 and 450 pounds.",

    "Llamas have excellent sight, smell and hearing, which are used for detection of potential danger.",
    "Llamas are very social animals. They live in groups composed of up to 20 animals called herds.",
    "Llamas are known as animals that spit when provoked or threatened. They can spit at humans also, but they usually spit at each other to solve misunderstandings in the group. ",
    "Llamas are very intelligent, but stubborn animals. When the load on its back is too heavy, a llama will refuse to carry it until some of the load is removed.",

    "Llamas come in a range of solid and spotted colors including black, gray, beige, brown, red and white.",
    "Llamas have two wild \"cousins\" which have never been domesticated: the vicuña and the guanaco.",
    "The current population of llamas and alpacas in South America is estimated to be more than 7 million, and there are about 158,000 llamas and 100,000 alpacas in the U.S. and Canada today.",
    "Trying to tell the difference between a llama and an alpaca? Two obvious things to look for: Llamas are generally about twice the size of alpacas, and alpacas have short, pointy ears, whereas llamas have much longer ears that stand straight up and give them an alert look.",
    "Llamas, as domesticated animals who live primarily in captivity, do not face any risk of endangerment.",

    "Llamas contribute much more than transportation to the human communities in which they live. Leather is made from their hides, and their wool is crafted into ropes, rugs, and fabrics. Llama dung makes great fuel—and fertilizer. In fact, it may have helped the Incans grow corn and survive in the Andes.",
    "Despite their large size, llamas feet have on average less of an impact on the ground than a hiker’s boots.",
    "The llama is the national symbol of Peru and appears on many tourist products as well as coins and stamps.",

    "To help with glare and avoid snow-blindness, llamas' eyes are designed with special sunshades built in that look like a curtain of ruffles hanging in the eyeball and close like Venetian blinds when needed.",
    "Images of llamas appear throughout the art of the Andes culture dating back thousands of years, occuring almost as often as images of the sun (which contained major religious symbolism.",
    "Unlike the camel, llamas require fresh water daily (though they do need considerably less than a horse or cow of comparable size).",
    "As a testimony to the popularity of these creatures, an activity known as \"llama trekking\" is offered by some llama farms, where visitors pay a fee to lead a llama around the property on a small nature walk.",
    "In nature, dominant male llamas will gather harems of females and guard them from the intrusion of other males.",
    "Llamas are so intelligent that they are known to learn simple tasks, such as fetching an object, with only a few repitions (far fewer than a dog would take).",
    "A single male llama introduced to a herd of sheep, alpaca, or similar smaller herding animals will quickly become attached, claim the herd as their own, and defend them from animals such as foxes and coyotes.",
    "Occasionally, ranchers have reported stories of scuffles overheard in the night, and the trampled bodies of coyotes, wolves and even small bears being found in the llama pen in the morning -Amazing!"
